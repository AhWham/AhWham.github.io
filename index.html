      <h2>Welcome to my Website</h2>

      <p class="intro-text"><br>Welcome to my website, if you have no idea who I am welcome.<br> My name is AhWham, I am an digital artist with hopes of also becoming an 3d artist, comic maker, coder, and game designer, tall order I know. <br>This is my first real stab at making a website with HTML and CSS, a way to test myself and learn how to use GitHub properly. With this website I keep an archive of all if not an majority of my art, which can be found in the Art Page at the top or the button below. Along with Art I have links to my social media platforms where you may support me, those links are in my Support Page at the top of the page or the button below.</p>
      <p><br> I will do my best to update and keep up with this website, I'll be adding Art as it comes along along with new features or pages</p>
